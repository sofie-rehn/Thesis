Scripts for my thesis work. 

The modifed DADA2 script is based on the "DADA2 Pipeline Tutorial (1.8)" but modified according to the processed data (Nanopore single-end reads). 
The script "splittingFasta" contains the script for splitting larger fasta files into smaller sections as well as splitting longer sequences according to entered start and stop positions. 
The script "saccharis_modified" contains my code for installing and using SACCHARIS (pipeline for CAZyme annotation).
